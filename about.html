            Hello, my name is Brian. I am twenty one, and have been simply infatuated with video games since the beginning.
            I still do not have a solid narrowed down goal on what exactly I wish to do with video games. All I care about is doing something with them.
            Whether it be art, coding, or playing them. Any of the above and I could not be happier.
        </p>
